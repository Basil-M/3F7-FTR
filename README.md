# Non-binary compression algorithms
_Third year coursework for module 3F7: Information Theory and Coding_

Huffman coding and Arithmetic coding are binary compression algorithms based upon assigning more frequent symbols lower code lengths, thereby reducing the expected length of the code.
This projected involved developing and characterising non-binary versions of these algorithms. Representing data in a non-binary format is inherently inefficient on our binary computer systems (though the development of quantum computing may represent an interesting use case) - however it has been shown that considering compression in other powers of 2 e.g. base 256 can yield significant speed improvements with a negligible decrease in compression ratios.

## Results
The results of this investigation are documented in [the report submitted](Final_Report_with_Feedback.pdf).
